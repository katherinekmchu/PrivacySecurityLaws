Gramm-Leach Bliley Act
=========

The [Gramm Leach Bliley Act](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ102/html/PLAW-106publ102.htm), also known as the *Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999*, or GLBA, was enacted, in part, to repeal part of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, and in part, to address privacy concerns. In terms of compliance, the key rules under the GLBA include *The Financial Privacy Rule* which governs the collection and disclosure of customer's personal information by financial institutions, while *The Safeguards Rule* requires all financial institutions to design, implement and maintain safeguards to protect customer information. 


PRIVACY RULE
--------------
```
Introduction
```
Title V, Subtitle A of the GLBA governs the treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers by financial institutions. 
-*Section 502* of the Subtitle, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal info (NPI) about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements, and provided that the consumer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. 
-*Section 503* requires the institution to provide notice of its privacy policies and practices to its customers.
-*Section 504* authorizes the issuance of regulations to impelemt these provisions.

In 2000, the four federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration ("NCUA") published regulations implementing provisions of the GLBA governing the treatment of NPI. The regulations can be summarized as follows:
- A financial institution must provide a notice of its privacy policies, and allow the consumer to opt out of the disclosure of the consumer's nonpublic personal information, to a nonaffiliated third party if the disclosure is outside of the exceptions in section 13, 14 or 15 of the regulations. 
- Regardless of whether a financial institution shares NPI, the institution must provide notices of its privacy policies to its customers. 
- A financial institution generally may not disclose customer account no.'s to any nonaffiliated third party for marketing purposes. 
- A financial institution must follow reuse and redisclosure limitations on any nonpublic personal information it receives from a nonaffiliated financial institution. 

In 2009, a model privacy notice form was published in which financial institutions may use to receive a safe harbor in compliance with the notice requirements.
