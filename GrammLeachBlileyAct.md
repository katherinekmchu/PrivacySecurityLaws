Gramm-Leach Bliley Act
=========

The [Gramm Leach Bliley Act](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ102/html/PLAW-106publ102.htm), also known as the *Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999*, or GLBA, was enacted, in part, to repeal part of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, and in part, to address privacy concerns. In terms of compliance, the key rules under the GLBA include *The Financial Privacy Rule* which governs the collection and disclosure of customer's personal information by financial institutions, while *The Safeguards Rule* requires all financial institutions to design, implement and maintain safeguards to protect customer information. 


PRIVACY RULE
--------------
```
Introduction
```
Title V, Subtitle A of the GLBA governs the treatment of Nonpublic Personal Information ("NPI") about consumers by financial institutions. 

NPI is any personally identifiable information that a financial institution collects about an individual in connection with providing a financial product or service, unless that info is otherwise publicly available. 

*Section 502* of the Subtitle, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a financial institution from disclosing NPI about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements, and provided that the consumer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. 

*Section 503* requires the institution to provide notice of its privacy policies and practices to its customers.

*Section 504* authorizes the issuance of regulations to impelemt these provisions.

```
Who is Covered
```
- Financial Institutions: any institution the business of which is engaging in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities, as determined by section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956; or
- If you receive NPI from a Financial Institution with which you are not affiliated with

```
What the Law Requires
```
In 2000, the four federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration ("NCUA") published regulations implementing provisions of the GLBA governing the treatment of NPI. The regulations can be summarized as follows:
- A financial institution must provide a notice of its privacy policies, and allow the consumer to opt out of the disclosure of the consumer's nonpublic personal information, to a nonaffiliated third party if the disclosure is outside of the exceptions in section 13, 14 or 15 of the regulations. 
- Regardless of whether a financial institution shares NPI, the institution must provide notices of its privacy policies to its customers. 
- A financial institution generally may not disclose customer account no.'s to any nonaffiliated third party for marketing purposes. 
- A financial institution must follow reuse and redisclosure limitations on any nonpublic personal information it receives from a nonaffiliated financial institution. 

The Exceptions. A Financial institution need not comply with opt-out requirements if they limit disclosure of NPI: 
- Section 13 *Service Provider* Exception: To a nonaffiliated third party to perform services for the financial institution or to function on its behalf, including marketing the institution's own products or services. The exception is permitted only if the financial institution provides notice of these arrangements, and by contract, prohibits the third party from disclosing or using the information for other than the specified purposes. The contract must provide that the parties to the agreement are jointly offering, sponsoring, or endorsing a financial product or service. Note - if the service function is covered under exceptions Section 14 and/or 15, then the institution does not need to comply with the additional disclosure and confidentiality requirements of section 13. 
- Section 14 Exception: Necessary to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction that a consumer requests or authorizes, or under certain circumstances, relating to existing relationships with customers. Examples - audit credit information, administer a rewards program, or to provide account statement. 
- Section 15 *Routine Business* Exception: A disclosure the institution normally makes. Examples - institute anti-fraud programs, or to the institution's attorneys, accountants, and auditors, or to comply with appliable legal requirements. 


```
How to Comply
```
- Notice Duties: In general, the Financial Institution must provide to Consumers a privacy notice that describes its practices and policies with respect to disclosure of NPI to affiliated or nonaffiliated third parties. Consumers who are not customers are entitled to an initial privacy and opt out notice only if their financial institution wants to share their NPI with nonaffiliated third parties outside the exceptions. A customer is entitled to initial and annual privacy notices regardless of the information disclosure practices. The initial notice must be provided no later than the time a customer relationship is established. 

- Required Disclosures: categories of info collected; categories of info disclosed; categories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom the institution may disclose information; policies with respect to the treatment of former customers' information; information disclosed to service providers and joint marketers (Section 13); an explanation of opt out rights and method for opt out; any opt out notices the institution must provide under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) with respect to affiliate info sharing; policies for protecting the security and confidentiliaty of info; and a statement that the institution makes disclosures to other nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law (Section 14 and 15) 

- Opt Out Right and Exceptions: The notice must include opt out notice and, among other things, a reasonable means and opportunity to opt out.

- Safe Harbor: [The Model Privacy Notice Form](http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/rules/privacy-consumer-financial-information-financial-privacy-rule/model_form_rule_a_small_entity_compliance_guide.pdf) can be used by institutions to comply with their notice requirements. To obtain the safe harbor, the institution must provide a model form in accordance with the instructions as set forth in each federal banking agency's privacy regulation. 

- Redisclosure and Reuse Limitations:  Redisclosure and reuse of NPI received by financial institution is limited. 

*For NPI received under Section 14 or 15 exceptions, the institution is limited to:
- Disclosing the info to the affiliates of the financial institution from which it received the info; 
- Disclosing the info to its own affiliates, who may, in turn, disclose and use the info only to the extent that the institution can do so; and 
- disclosing and using the info pursuant to a section 14 or 15 exception (example - an institution receiving information for account processing could disclose the info to its auditors). 

*For NPI received other than under Section 14 and 15, the recipients use is unlimited but disclosure is limited to:
- Disclosing the info to the affiliates of the institution from which it received the info; 
- Disclosing the info to its own affiliates, who may in turn disclose the info only to the extent the institution can do so; and
- Disclosing the info to any other person, if the disclosure would be lawful if made directly to that person by the financial institution from which it received the info. For example, an institution that received a customer list from another financial institution could disclose the list (1) in accordance with the privacy policy of the financial institution that provided the list, (2) subject to any opt out or revocation by customers; and (3) in accordance with appropriate exceptions under Section 14 and 15. 



SAFEGUARD RULE 
--------------
The GLBA required regulators of Financial Institution to establish appropriate standards relating to administrative, technical and physical safeguards - 
1. To ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and info; 
2. to protect against anticipated threats/ hazards to the security or integrity of such records; and
3. to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or info which could result in substantial harm/ inconvenience to any customer 


FTC implements the GLBA objectives and requires: 
- Info security program to satisfy GLBA objectives
- Risk assessments
- Implementation of safeguards and monitoring of such 
- Oversight of service providers
- Evaluate and adjust the program 


Other Matters 
--------------

```
Fair Credit Reporting Act
```
GLBA does not modify, limit or supersede the operations of the FCRA, which, in part, requires any business or individual, who uses a consumer report for a business purpose, to protect against unauthorized access and use of the information.
